# Baisc MERN Skeleton

## Project Description

This project was built using the guide provided by Shama Hoque in 'Full-Stack React Projects - 2nd Edition' published by Packt. It provides a basic method for authenticating a user with JSON Web Tokens. Users can be created, user profiles can be edited and deleted provided the user is authenticated and authorized to edit/delete the profile.

The project is intended to be used a starting point for custom web applications that require basic user authenticaiton and authorization. It can be extended for various types of projects. 

Mostly this repo served as my own project for learning how to build a simple MERN web application framework for user authentication and authorization. If you're learning I strongly recommend going through the projects in the book yourself. Here's the [link](https://www.packtpub.com/product/full-stack-react-projects-second-edition/9781839215414).
